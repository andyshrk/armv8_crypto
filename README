ARMv8 Crypto Library
====================

This package contains source code of low-level crypto operations
for ARMv8 processors as well as C interface to that code.
The intention behind this implementation is to speed up cryptographic
operations in use cases particularly useful for data plane,
such as chained cipher + hash.
